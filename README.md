This was my final project for my Intro to Data Science class I was enrolled in for the Fall 2021 semester at the University of Maryland. This was the final assignment. Students are allowed to work as partners and choose a dataset to perform various analyses on. This project was submitted by me and my partner, Alexander  Straub. 

We chose the openpowerlifting dataset because it is very close to complete. That is, the volunteers who run the website openpowerlifting.org try to the best of their ability to log as much of powerlifting meet data into this project as possible. Additionally, I follow a handful of powerlifting and exercise science podcasts from which I have learned a few commonly held beliefs about the effect of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) and sex on performance. We analyzed this in various ways in our explanatory data analysis (EDA). After this, we used our data set to run several machine learning algorithms to further study the effects of the aforementioned variables.
